## Key File Descriptions
### 1. Paper Screening and Data Extraction.xlsx
The core Excel file records the full lifecycle of the SLR process:
- List of 437 initially retrieved papers (in "all" sheet)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria, results and exclusion reasons for excluded papers (in "all" sheet, and the "candidates" sheet displays the 192 papers after the initial inclusion/exclusion steps)
- Complete data extraction and analysis content of the final 109 selected papers (in "ordering (selected papers)" sheet and all other sheets)

### 2. Plotting Script/
This directory contains all files to reproduce the charts in the paper:
- `Data Table/`: Structured data tables split from the core Excel file, used as input for plotting scripts
- `Figure/`: All charts generated by Python scripts (consistent with the charts in the paper)
- `.py` scripts: Independent scripts for generating corresponding charts in the paper
